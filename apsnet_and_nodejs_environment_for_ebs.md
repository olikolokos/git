Execute generate a 1024 bits key like the image below

After generating the public, open Putty software and at the ssh section save you private and add it to Putty.

For the final step, add the ip address or the servername to "HostName" field(22 is the default port).

Now if you are using Linux you'll use a cli ssh-client.
First install the ssh software:

```sudo apt-get install ssh```


then generate your rsa public key by typing:

```ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your.mail@bravi.com.br"```

Copy the content of .ssh/id_rsa.pub:

```cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub```

And send to helpdesk, when helpdesk confirm your ssh key you can access the server by typing:

```ssh root@ebs-node.bravi.com.br```

Or

```ssh root@192.168.150.210```
